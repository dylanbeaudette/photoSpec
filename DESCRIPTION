Description: photoSpec allows one to apply Beer's Law to a photograph containing color swatches/paint chips.  The motivation is to provide a method for "spectrophotometry" of objects that cannot be chemically analyzed because of their fragility, value or non-extractability.  Functions are provided to understand color concepts, to select calibration colors, to print a sample card containing calibration colors and a space for a sample to be photographed, and to analyze the results.
