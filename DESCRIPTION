Description: photoSpec allows one to use a photograph as a spectrophotometer, much in the manner that one might match the color of an object to a paint color at a hardware store.  Functions are provided to plot the CIE chromaticity diagram, select calibration colors, print a sample card containing calibration colors and a space for a sample to be photographed, and to analyze the results.  The motivating idea is to apply Beer's Law to objects that cannot be chemically analyzed.
