\title{
photoSpec: A photographic spectrophotometer
}
\description{
photoSpec allows one to apply Beer's Law to a photograph containing color swatches (paint chips) and a sample to be analyzed.  The motivation is to provide a method for 'spectrophotometry' of objects that cannot be chemically analyzed because of their value or non-extractability.  Functions in the package cover the entire workflow from generating calibration colors to obtaining a quantitative answer analogous to concentration in Beer's Law.
