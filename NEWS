##### Version 0.4-0
Date: 2013-06-15
>> An entirely different approach to generating calibration colors was implemented.  The new approach is based upon the Munsell system rather than the CIE system.  The fitting to the calibration colors is now uses principal curves.  All aspects are much more straight-forward.
>> CITATION file removed.  KM added as a contributor in DESCRIPTION.
>> plotSampleCard gains the ability to decrease the number of calibration colors provided so that they fit on the card.
>> Added a serial number process to plotSampleCard.
>> Updates to documentation.

##### Version 0.3-0
Date: 2013-06-12
>> The 'band' approach to selecting colors has been abandoned for a 'grid' approach which is faster (no more parallel processing) and completely reproducible (no more sampling).  These changes apply to selectCalCols.  The band approach is relegated to the 0.2 series archive.
>> Internal functions now properly organized.

##### Version 0.2-4
Date: 2013-06-07
>> Significant improvements to plotSampleCard.
>> plotCIEchrom now displays ff and colSpace settings in corner.
>> Improvements to the documentation.

##### Version 0.2-3
Date: 2013-06-04
>> A few more small changes.

##### Version 0.2-2
Date: 2013-06-02
>> Various small changes based upon preliminary testing.

##### Version 0.2-1
Date: 2013-06-02
>> Improvements to documentation, though more are needed.
>> Added parallel processing as the default when determining which colors are in which bands in selectCalCols.

##### Version 0.2-0
Date: 2013-06-01
>> Many significant changes in design and operation.  There are still numerous issues to be fixed but this is much more mature.  There are some real problems with speed to be addressed as well.
>> Calibration is now carried out using PCA.
>> A new class, CIEwedge, was created to hold much of the common information passed between functions.

##### Version 0.1-5
Date: 2013-05-22
>> selectCIEchrom now returns a list of values which will be passed to a new function selectCalCols.  All wavelength combinations are properly handled AFAICS.
>> Added function selectCalCols.  This generates a series of calibration colors.
>> Added function genCalCols, a wrapper to drive the previous two functions.
>> Switched to ByteCompile as there are speed problems with prepCIEgradient.

##### Version 0.1-4
Date: 2013-05-04
>> Fixed selectCIExy to handle any wavelength combination.
>> Removed plotCIEselection and gave its job to plotCIEchrom.  This is more compact and will be easier to maintain.
>> selectCIExy now returns all the colors in the space delimited by L1 and L2.  We'll need to determine how to handle this: a 1 nm band is roughly 100-200 colors, which is too many for the calibration process.

##### Version 0.1-3
Date: 2013-05-01
>> Added a proto-vignette.
>> Added grid.newpage() to several functions.
>> Broke out the gradient computations into a new function, prepCIEgradient.
>> Added selectCIExy (depending upon the wavelengths chosen, it breaks)
>> Added enough documentation to pass checks.

##### Version 0.1-2
Date: 20 April 2013
>> Improved documentation.

##### Version 0.1-1
Date: 18 April 2013
>> Added handling of any number of calCols to plotSampleCard.

##### Version 0.1-0
Date: 16 April 2013
>> First release in a version that builds and checks.  The 0.1 series is for proof of concept and there are several features that are implemented in less-than-ideal fashion.  These will eventually be improved.
