##### Version 0.1-4
Date: 2013-05-
>> Fixed selectCIExy to handle any wavelength combination.
>> Removed plotCIEselection and gave its job to plotCIEchrom.  This is more compact and will be easier to maintain.
>> selectCIExy now returns all the colors in the space delimited by L1 and L2.  We'll need to determine how to handle this: a 1 nm band is roughly 100-200 colors, which is too many for the calibration process.

##### Version 0.1-3
Date: 2013-05-01
>> Added a proto-vignette.
>> Added grid.newpage() to several functions.
>> Broke out the gradient computations into a new function, prepCIEgradient.
>> Added selectCIExy (depending upon the wavelengths chosen, it breaks)
>> Added enough documentation to pass checks.

##### Version 0.1-2
Date: 20 April 2013
>> Improved documentation.

##### Version 0.1-1
Date: 18 April 2013
>> Added handling of any number of calCols to plotSampleCard.

##### Version 0.1-0
Date: 16 April 2013
>> First release in a version that builds and checks.  The 0.1 series is for proof of concept and there are several features that are implemented in less-than-ideal fashion.  These will eventually be improved.
